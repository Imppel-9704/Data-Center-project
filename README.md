# Data platform project

This repo is the sample code of this project.

From the start my team needs to know the performance of ad campaigns that they have created but they were struggle with export data from each platforms. They also want the overview of all platforms. Therefore, We have started this project.

I have created a data pipeline to automate the process of extracting, transforming, and loading data from zip files into Google BigQuery. I also performed data transformations such as joining and cleaning data, queried the data in Google BigQuery to get specific insights, and then connected the data to Google Looker Studio to create data visualizations.
