# Data Center project

Sample code of work on data center project.
This project I have cleaned data from each social media platforms. Then store the data in Google BigQuery for visualization.

From the start, our team needs dashboard which can analyze about cost spend that we have spent on ads for each social media platform. But we don't have any stored historical data. Therefore, We started the project.
I have cleaned data, joined data with the data in Google Spreadsheet, uploaded data to Google Cloud Storage by using Google Cloud Function and wrote custom query for visualization dashboard.
